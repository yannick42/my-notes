***Welcome** on the published part of my note-taking system, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) community plugin. I will try to update this site regularly on themes like **mathematics** (at an undergraduate level), **computer science & engineering** and **machine learning**, mostly.*
