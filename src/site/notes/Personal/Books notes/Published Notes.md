*Welcome on the published part of my note-taking system, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) community plugin. I will try to update this site regularly on the themes of **mathematics** (undergraduate), **computing** and **machine learning**.*
