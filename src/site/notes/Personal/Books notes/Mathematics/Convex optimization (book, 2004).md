-> pdf : [[Convex Optimization - 2004 - Boyd.pdf]]
- an **introduction** to the subject

> The focus of the book is on **recognizing convex optimization problems** and then **finding the most appropriate technique for solving them**. It contains many worked examples and homework exercises and will appeal to **students, researchers and practitioners** in fields such as ==engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, finance, and economics==.
