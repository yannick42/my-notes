### Chapter 5 - Modeling distributions
- empirical distribution defined by their CDF (cumulative distribution function)

#### 5.1 - Exponential distribution
- $CDF(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}$
- $\lambda$ determines the shape of the function : only **one parameter** to summarize this distribution
	- it can be interpreted as a "rate" of events that occurs in a unit of time
	- the mean is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$
- it appears when measuring times between events ("interarrival times") if events are equally likely to occur
	- eg. ==baby births in an hospital== in a day
- to verify you can model your data with an exponential distribution, one can take the "complementary CDF" from the sample data (*empirical distribution*), and use a log-scale on the y axis : it should be a straight line of slope $-\lambda$ 

#### 5.2 - Normal distribution

==TODO==

#### 5.3 - Normal probability plot
- to test whether the normal distribution is a good model to use for the problem at hand
- ==TODO==

#### 5.4 - The lognormal distribution
- If the $\log$ of the data values have a normal distribution
- eg. ==the distribution of adult weight ?!==
- ==TODO==

#### 5.5 - The Pareto distribution
- Named after an economist Vilfredo Pareto to describe to distribution of wealth
	- "*Since then, it has been used to describe phenomena in the natural and social sciences including **sizes of cities and towns**, **sand particles and meteorites**, **forest fires and earthquakes***"
- ==TODO==
