- a basic (and powerful) mathematical tool for non-linear [[Topics/Mathematics/Optimization|optimization]] problems that can be equality or inequality constrained
- the goal is to find a *local* extrema of a real function $f(x,y,...)$ subject to a constraint $g(x,y,...)=k$
- it's widely used/applied in science, economics and engineering, and "everyday life" (?)
	- maximizing profit subject to a limited resource
	- $\lambda$ often has an identifiable significance
	- in power systems : (economic) $\lambda-$dispatch is used to minimize the hourly cost of production
		- => calculate the optimal generation scheduling : to know which of the $i$ generators to use
- the "max" is when both gradients are identical : $\nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \lambda \nabla g(x_0,y_0)$
	- tangent line (or surface, ...)
- They can be multiple constraints => ? at least 2...?

### Definition
- the Lagrange function $\mathcal{L}(x,\lambda)=f(x)-\lambda g(x)$
- (KKT conditions ?)

---
### Applications
- **The problem of Dido** : which curve has the maximum area for a given perimeter
	- https://mathematicalgarden.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/the-problem-of-dido/
		- it uses
			- [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Green's theorem (vector calculus)|Green's theorem (vector calculus)]]
			- Euler-Lagrange equations

#### Applications in ML
- in **PCA** and **SVM**
