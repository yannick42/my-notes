- Principal Component Analysis
- Invented by [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Karl Pearson|Karl Pearson]] in **1901**, then later independently developed and "named" by [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Harold Hotelling|Harold Hotelling]], **1933**
- useful **linear** transformation technique -> ?
	- like [[Topics/Mathematics/LDA|LDA]]
- PCA ignores "class" labels, it finds the directions that maximize [[Topics/Mathematics/Statistics and probabilities/Variance|variance]]
- Projection in a small subspace

	- in 3 steps
		- Eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix
			- or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) **to improve the computational efficiency**
		- Selection Principal Components
		- Projection onto the new feature space


### TODO
- [ ] Reread and code Raschka's tutorial
- [ ] Do classification on PCA -> iris dataset, ...etc (?)
