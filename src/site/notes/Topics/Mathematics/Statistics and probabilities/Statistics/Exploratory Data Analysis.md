**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- to summarize the main characteristics of a dataset
- promoted by [[John Tukey|John Tukey]] since **1970**
	- he wrote a book in **1977**
- **EDA** encompass **IDA** (initial data analysis : to check assumptions, handling missing values, ...)
- to ==discover== patterns, anomalies (outliers), and ==form hypotheses==
- univariate/multivariate methods :
