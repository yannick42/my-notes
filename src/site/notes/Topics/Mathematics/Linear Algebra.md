### Basic Topics/definitions
- [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Matrices|Matrices]]
- column vector -> ?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix -> ?
- Subspaces
- Basis
	- a **generating set** of $V$ : can "express" all vectors in $V$ as a linear combination of some vectors of $\mathcal{A}$
	- a **span** is the set of all linear combination of the generating set $\mathcal{A}$
	- **basis** : the ==minimal generating set== (linearly independent ?)
- **Rank** of a matrix => the number of linearly independent **column** of the matrix
-  Matrice échelonnée réduite : RREF (Reduced row-echelon form)
- [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Gaussian elimination|Gaussian Elimination]]
- [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Eigenvalues|eigenvalues]], eigenvectors, eigenspectrum, ...
- Linear mapping
- (or vector space hom(e?)omorphism, or linear transformation) -> preserve the structure of the vector space (multiplication by a scalar, addition of vectors)
	- ==can be represented as matrices==
