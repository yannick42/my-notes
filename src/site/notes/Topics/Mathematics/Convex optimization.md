- we can guarantee global optimality

### Definitions
- **Convex set** $C$ : if the line segment between every two points A and B is inside the set $C$
	- so the affine combination : $(1-t)x + ty$ belongs to $C$
- dual problem / primal problem
	- 
- [[Topics/Mathematics/Linear programming|Linear programming]] : 
- Quadratic programming
