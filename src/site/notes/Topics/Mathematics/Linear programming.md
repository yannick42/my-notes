- a Framework in constrained optimization
- **Goal** : to achieve the best outcome (maximum profit / lowest cost) with a problem of linear relationships
	- equality / inequality constraints
- It's a special case of "mathematical programming"
- Intersection of many half-spaces => polyhedron
- **Applications** in
	- Mathematics
	- Economic problems / Business planning
	- Engineering / Industry
		- Transportation problems
		- Energy, Telecommunications
		- Manufacturing
	- => in problems like : ==**routing**, **planning**, **scheduling**, **assignment**, **design**(?)==
