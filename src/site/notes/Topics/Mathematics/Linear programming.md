- a Framework in constrained optimization
- **Goal** : to achieve the best outcome (maximum profit / lowest cost) with a problem of linear relationships
	- equality / inequality constraints
- It's a special case of "mathematical programming"
- Intersection of many half-spaces => polyhedron
- **Applications** in
	- Mathematics
	- Economic problems / Business planning
	- Engineering / Industry
		- Transportation problems
		- Energy, Telecommunications
		- Manufacturing
	- => in problems like : ==**routing**, **planning**, **scheduling**, **assignment**, **design**(?)==

### Methods
- [[Simplex methods]] (**1947**, George Dantzig)
	- exponential complexity ? (slow if too much constraints)
- *Interior point method*
	- **Ellipsoid algorithm** (**1979**, Leonid Khachiyan)
		- polynomial-time algorithm
	- **1984**, Narenda Karmarkar)

### Peoples
- Dantzig
- Khachiyan
- Karmarkar
