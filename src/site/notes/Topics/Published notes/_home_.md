***Welcome** on the published part of my note-taking system, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) community plugin. I will try to update this site regularly on themes like **software development**, **mathematics** (at an undergraduate level), **computer science** in general and **machine learning**, mostly.*

*Entries are not timestamped as in a blog, but are more like notes that should evolve through time.*

> Most pages are still ðŸš§ **==UNDER CONSTRUCTION==** ðŸš§ and were last published in **April 2022**

### Reading (In Progress)
- [[Topics/Published notes/MML (home)|Mathematics for Machine Learning (2020)]] book notes & exercices (**DONE : 36%**)
- [[Topics/Published notes/HoML2 (home)|Hands-on Machine Learning with Sklearn & Tensorflow (2020)]] book notes & exercices (**DONE : 40%**)
- [[Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On]] book notes (**DONE : 15%**)
