***Welcome** toattachements__/files/favicon.svg the published part of my note-taking system, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) community plugin. I will try to update this site regularly on themes like **software development**, **mathematics** (at an undergraduate level), **computer science** in general, **data science** and **machine learning**, mostly.*

*Entries are not timestamped as in a blog, but are more like "personal" technical notes that should evolve through time. I update them as I learn more about each topics. I hope you find it useful for your own learning.*

> Most pages are still ðŸš§ **==UNDER CONSTRUCTION==** ðŸš§ and some links still missing...
> Last published in **July 2022**

You can also access my Jupyter notebooks, [here](https://notebooks.yannick42.dev). It contains various [[Topics/Mathematics/Statistics and probabilities/Statistics/Exploratory Data Analysis|EDA]] on datasets and ML tests.
