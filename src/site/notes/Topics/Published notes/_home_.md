***Welcome** on the published part of my note-taking system, based on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden) community plugin. I will try to update this site regularly on themes like **software development**, **mathematics** (at an undergraduate level), **computer science** in general, **data science** and **machine learning**, mostly.*

*Entries are not timestamped as in a blog, but are more like notes that should evolve through time.*

> Most pages are still 🚧 **==UNDER CONSTRUCTION==** 🚧 and were last published in **April 2022**
