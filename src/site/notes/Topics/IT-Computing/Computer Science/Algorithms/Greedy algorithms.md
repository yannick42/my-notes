**Greedy algorithms**
- *fr: algorithme glouton*
- a simple heuristic method to solve a problem, used in [[Topics/Mathematics/Optimization|optimization]] problems, it uses the best option available at the moment
- so it doesn't worry if the result will be optimal or not
- eg.
	- in the **coin change problem** to pay with the minimal number of coins : use the biggest possible coin at each step
	- Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm ([[Topics/IT-Computing/Computer Science/Algorithms/Minimum Spanning Tree|minimum spanning tree]])
	- [[Topics/IT-Computing/Computer Science/Algorithms/Beam search (1976)|Beam search (1976)]]
