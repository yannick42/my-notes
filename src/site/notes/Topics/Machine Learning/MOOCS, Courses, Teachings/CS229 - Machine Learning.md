- **broad introduction** to [[Topics/Machine Learning/Machine Learning|Machine Learning]] and statistical pattern recognition.

> http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html
> https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229

### Prerequisites
- **==basic probability theory==** : **Stat 116** (sufficient but not necessary)
	- **Probability spaces** as models for phenomena with statistical regularity. **Discrete spaces** (binomial, hypergeometric, Poisson). **Continuous spaces** (normal, exponential) and densities. [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Random variables|Random variables]], expectation, independence, [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Probabilité conditionnelle|conditional probability]]. Introduction to **the laws of large numbers** and **[[___INBOX___/__à trier/Central limit theorem|central limit theorem]]**
- **basic linear algebra** :
	- Math 51
	- Math 103
	- Math 113 or CS 205 (would be much more than necessary)
