- "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in [[Topics/IT-Computing/Programming/R|R]]"
	- aka. **ISL**
	- website : https://www.statlearning.com/
	- by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Trevor Hastie|Trevor Hastie]] & [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Robert Tibshirani|Robert Tibshirani]]
		- some of them also wrote : [[Topics/Machine Learning/Books/The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)|The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)]], first published in **2001**
- broad and **less technical** treatment of topic (than the **ESL**)
- ==audience==
	- appropriate for **advanced undergraduates** or **masterâ€™s students** in Statistics or related quantitative fields, or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data
	- We expect that **the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics**
	- The mathematical level of this book is **modest**, and a detailed knowledge of matrix operations is not required.
- textbook of a course **spanning two semesters**
- Youtube playlists of chapters : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/playlists

### QUESTIONS
- [x] What's the difference between **statistical learning** & **statistical inference** ?
	- => **Inference** : is to find/choose a "configuration" based on a single input, **Learning** : to extract statistical patterns and predict on unseen data
	- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/205253/what-is-the-difference-between-learning-and-inference

### Chapter 1 : Introduction

#### A brief history of  Statistical Learning
- in the beginning of **19th century** : [[___INBOX___/__Ã  trier/Least-squares method|Least-squares]]
- [[Topics/Mathematics/Linear discriminant analysis|Linear discriminant analysis]] is proposed in **1936**
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Models/Neural Networks|Neural Networks]] in the **1980s**
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Models/Support Vector Machine (1992)|SVM]] arose in the **1990s**

---
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Books/The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)|The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)]] was first published in **2001**, important reference for the fundamentals of statistical learning (comprehensive and detailed). Companion for professionals (==with **graduate degrees in statistics, machine learning**, or related fields==) to understand technical details.
- **ISL** is based on ==4 premises==
	- "(...methods) **relevant and useful** in a wide range of academic and non-academic disciplines"
	- "Statistical learning **should not be viewed as** a series of **black boxes**"
	- "we have **minimized discussion of technical details** related to fitting procedures and theoretical properties"
	- "We presume that ==the reader is interested== in **applying statistical learning methods to real-world problems**."
â†’ `less technical, more accessible`
