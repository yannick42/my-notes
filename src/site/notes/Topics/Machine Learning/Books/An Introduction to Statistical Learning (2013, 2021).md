- "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with applications in [[Topics/IT-Computing/Programming/R|R]]"
	- aka. **ISL**
	- website : https://www.statlearning.com/
	- by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Trevor Hastie|Trevor Hastie]] & [[Topics/Mathematics/People/Robert Tibshirani|Robert Tibshirani]]
		- some of them also wrote : [[Topics/Machine Learning/Books/The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)|The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009, 2016)]], first published in **2001**
- broad and **less technical** treatment of topic (than the **ESL**)
- ==audience==
	- appropriate for **advanced undergraduates** or **master’s students** in Statistics or related quantitative fields, or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data
	- We expect that **the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics**
	- The mathematical level of this book is **modest**, and a detailed knowledge of matrix operations is not required.
- textbook of a course **spanning two semesters**

### Chapter 1 : Introduction

#### A brief history of  Statistical Learning
- in the beginning of **19th century** : [[___INBOX___/__à trier/Least-squares method|Least-squares]]
- [[Topics/Mathematics/Linear discriminant analysis|Linear discriminant analysis]] is proposed in **1936**
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Models/Support Vector Machine (1992)|SVM]] arose in the **1990s**

---
- **ISL** is based on ==4 premises==
	- "(...methods) **relevant and useful** in a wide range of academic and non-academic disciplines"
	- "Statistical learning **should not be viewed as** a series of **black boxes**"
	- "we have **minimized discussion of technical details** related to fitting procedures and theoretical properties"
	- "We presume that ==the reader is interested== in **applying statistical learning methods to real-world problems**."


## Chapters
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Books/An Introduction to Statistical Learning - Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning|Chapter 2 - Statistical Learning]]

---
### Chapter 3 - Linear Regression
- very simple approach to [[Topics/Machine Learning/Concepts/Supervised learning|supervised learning]]

==TODO==

---
### Chapter 4 - Classification
--> [[Topics/Machine Learning/Models/Logistic regression|Logistic regression]], [[Topics/Mathematics/Linear discriminant analysis|Linear discriminant analysis]]

#### 4.4 - Generative Models for classification
##### 4.4.1 - Linear Discriminant Analysis for p = 1
- -> only one predictor ()

##### 4.4.2 - Linear Discriminant Analysis for p > 1
- 

##### 4.4.3 - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis


---
### Chapter 5 - Resampling methods
- Cross validation (CV)
	- k-fold CV : ?

==TODO==

#### 5.2 - The Bootstrap (p. 209 -> 212)
- widely applicable, extremely powerful approach
- it can be used to quantify the **uncertainty** of a statistical method or estimator
	- eg. by **estimating the standard error** of a linear regression fit

==TODO==
