> Learning with (often delayed) rewards and penalties (negative rewards)
> - the study of learning intelligent behavior

### Definitions
- **policy $\pi(s)$** : map **states** to **actions**
- **value $V(s)$** : expected long-term **return** (as opposed to R : short-term reward)
- **Q-value (action-value) $Q(s,a)$** : similar to $V(s)$ but with $a$ (an action)
	- maps ==state action pairs== to **rewards**
- **policy-based** : better for continuous and stochastic environment, faster convergence
	- no need of Q-value as a middleman
	- Q-Learning, DQN, Double dueling Q Networks, ...
- **value-based** : more "sample efficient" (?) and steady
	- requires the transition model ? => **model-based ?**
- **[[___INBOX___/__Ã  trier/Model-free (RL)|Model-free (RL)]]** : doesn't use generated predictions from the (state-)transition probability distribution or the reward function, of the MDP. Those are "unknown".
	- SARSA, Q-Learning, DQN, actor-critic (A3C, ...), ...
	- Generally superior, if you don't have an accurate model as part of the problem definition => ??
- **model-based** : 
	- DP (Policy Iteration, Value Iteration)
- **on-policy** : 
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/Models/RL & DRL/Policy Gradient|Policy Gradient]] : by gradient descent
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/_Ã  trier/Temporal Difference learning|Temporal Difference learning]]
	- model-free
- **look-up table** representation / **tabular methods** : for small and discrete space (greatly restricts real applications...)
	- must be learned for every states, to learn an optimal policy...
- **MDP/Markovian assumption** => ?

### Tabular methods
- Dynamic Programming :
- Monte Carlo updates ?
- [[Topics/Machine Learning/_Ã  trier/Temporal Difference learning|Temporal difference]] (model-free, can learn online : no need to wait the end of the "episode")
	- $TD(0)$ : look ahead only 1 step
	- **SARSA** : 
	- Q-Learning ?
	- Double Q-Learning ?
